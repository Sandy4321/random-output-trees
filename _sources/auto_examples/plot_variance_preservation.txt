==============================================
Variance is preserved under random projections
==============================================

If a random projection matrix satisfies the Johson-Lindenstrauss, then
the variance computed on the randomly projected output space is equal to
the variance on the original output space up to an epsilon factor.

This is an illustration of Theorem 1 from the paper

    random projections of the output space for high dimensional multi-label
    classification. ECML-PKDD 2014, Nancy, France
